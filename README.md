# Connect4
1 player text game

## Objective

To beat the computer to a connect 4.

## How To Play

1. You can add one piece at at time in the column of your choosing.
2. Once the column is full, you cannot add any more pieces.
3. First player (player 1 or computer) to get 4 in a row wins.
4. Wins can be vertically, horizontally or diagonally.

## Further Work

I would like to make a GUI to work with this.
